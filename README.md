# Fibonacci performance comparison

Comparing recursive, recursive with memorization and iteratively computing the nth fibonacci number.

To run use `npm run start` command in your terminal.

The recursion method is commented out as it can take a long time to compute the 50th fibonacci number. If you wish to run it I would advise you reduce it to find the fibonacci of a smaller number.
